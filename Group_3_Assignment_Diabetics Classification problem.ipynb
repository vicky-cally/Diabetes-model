Review on all the ML Algorithms listed above

Detailed Explanation of KNN

K-Nearest Neighbours is a machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression problems. For a classification problem, KNN makes prediction based on the majority class why for a regression problem, it calculates the mean of it's nearest neighbour values.

How it works

In KNN, you assign a data point which is classified on the basis of it's K-nearest neighbours. To determine the value of K, the number of neighbors to consider, make use of cross-validation or other model evaluation techniques. Assuming k=3, You need the 3 nearest neighbours from the data point assigned by calculating the distance from the data point to all other data points(training data) using distance metrics. Distance metrics can be Euclidean distance, manhanttan distance and minkowski distance. The class that occurs the most among the K-nearest neighbours is assigned to the input data point.You can look at the image below.For a Regression problem, calculate the mean of the target values.

Advantages of KNN

It is easy to understand and implement.
It is applicable to both classification and regression problems.
It doesn't make assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
It doesn't require a training phase as it doesn't create an explicit model
Diadvantages and challenges of KNN

The computing cost of identifying neighbors increases as the dataset gets larger.
Scaling or normalizing the data is frequently required because KNN is sensitive to feature scale.
KNN performance tends to deteriorate in high-dimensional conditions.
In conclusion, KNN is an adaptable and comprehensible algorithm that can be applied to a range of applications, particularly those involving small to medium big datasets. It is a helpful tool in machine learning because of its simplicity, absence of assumptions, and adaptability. However, the dataset properties, the distance measure, and the choice of K can all have an influence on its performance.



Detailed Explanation of SVM

Effective for both regression and classification applications, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning technique. The aim of SVM is to locate the hyperplane in feature space that best divides the data into different categories. The main goal of support vector machines (SVM) is to maximize the margin between classes while minimizing classifcation errors. The support vectors are the data points that are closest to the decision boundary. For a regression problem, The objective of SVR is to locate a hyperplane that, within a certain margin, captures as much of the data as feasible.

How it works

Assuming we have a dataset with each data point represented by a set of features, incase of a binary classification, it can be 0 or 1. SVM aims to find a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes which is characterized by a weight vector (w) and bias (b) that minimizes the norm of the weight vector. The distance between the hyperplane and the closest data point from each class is called the margin, and it is this distance that SVM aims to optimize. The data points required for defining the ideal hyperplane are called support vectors. The diagram below shows how SVM works.

Advantages

SVM is appropriate for applications involving a large number of features because it works effectively in high-dimensional feature spaces.
It can be used for both classification and regression tasks.
It is less likely to overfit, particularly in areas with several dimensions.
It can handle non-linear relationships in the data because of the kernel technique.
Disadvantages and challenges

SVM training can need a lot of processing power, particularly for large datasets.
Experimentation may be necessary to select the ideal kernel and fine-tune the hyperparameters.
Compared to simpler models, the decision boundaries generated by SVM may be more difficult to understand.
In conclusion, support vector machines are strong, adaptable algorithms that perform well in a range of machine learning applications. They work especially effectively with high-dimensional datasets and situations where there is a clear class distinction. To get the best performance, parameters and kernels must be chosen carefully.



Detailed Explanation of DT A prevalent supervised machine learning technique for both regression and classification applications is the decision tree. It creates a tree-like structure with internal nodes representing decisions based on features, branches representing decisions' outcomes, and leaf nodes representing the final predicted outcome by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of input features.In machine learning, decision trees offer simplicity and a visual representation of the possibilities when formulating outcomes.

How it works

Assuming we are trying to do a binary classification of 0 or 1, decision tree will classify this by dividing the dataset recursively according to the input feature values. It will then select the characteristic that best divides the data into homogenous groups at each stage, maximizing a splitting criteria (e.g., mean squared error or Gini impurity). This technique generates a structure that resembles a tree until a halting requirement is satisfied. In regression, it's the mean of the target values; in classification, it's the projected result for each leaf node's majority class. Overfitting can be avoided by pruning. The resultant tree offers a simple to understand decision-making approach.

Advantages

Decision trees are simple to comprehend and analyze
Regarding the data's underlying distribution, decision trees don't make any assumptions.
Data with non-linear connections can be captured using decision trees.
Disadvantages and challenges

Overfitting of decision trees can occur, particularly when improper pruning occurs.
The structure of the tree can alter significantly in response to small changes in the data.
Decision trees may exhibit bias towards dominating classes in classification problems.
In conclusion, decision trees are popular machine learning models that are flexible and understandable. They provide interpretability and are appropriate for a variety of tasks. Pruning is one method for enhancing generalization performance, although caution must be used to prevent overfitting.



Detailed Explanation of RF The Random Forest algorithm is an ensemble learning technique that enhances overall accuracy and robustness by merging the predictions of several decision trees. Both regression and classification problems make extensive use of it. It determines the result by using the decision trees' predictions. By calculating the mean or average of the output from different trees, it makes predictions. The precision of the result increases with the number of trees.

How it works The way Random Forest operates is by bootstrapping (sampling with replacement) numerous decision trees from the original dataset and randomly selecting features at each split. The final prediction is more reliable and accurate than that of a single decision tree since the different trees average predictions for regression or vote for categorization. This method minimizes overfitting, effectively manages noise, and offers valuable insights into the significance of features. Because of its overall mechanism, Random Forest is an effective and adaptable ensemble learning method that may be applied to a variety of machine learning applications.Below is the pictorial representation.

RF%20image.PNG

Advantages

Compared to individual decision trees, Random Forest minimizes overfitting by employing several trees and randomization.
Random Forest yields better results than a single decision tree, particularly when dealing with complex datasets.
Random Forest can assess the importance of different features in making predictions.
Random Forest is resistant to data noise and anomalies.
Random Forest works well with datasets that have varying measurement units since it is insensitive to the size of the features.
Diadvantages and challenges

When compared to individual decision trees, Random Forest models might be more difficult to understand.
It can take a lot of computing power to train many decision trees, particularly for huge datasets.
In conclusion, Random Forest is an effective ensemble learning method that takes use of decision trees' advantages while resolving their drawbacks. Random Forest is an excellent choice for a range of machine learning applications because it offers great accuracy and robustness through the construction of many trees and the introduction of randomness.


STEPS TAKEN:

Data Acquisition

In order to make use of these algorithms, we employed a Diabetics dataset from Kaggle.

Summary of the dataset:

The data used for this analysis was collected and provided by the "National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases" as part of the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The dataset comprises instances from a larger database, with specific constraints. All patients included in the dataset belong to the Pima Indian heritage, which is a subgroup of Native Americans. Furthermore, all individuals in the dataset are females aged 21 and above.

In this project, we built classifcation models using K-Nearest Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.

Findings:

There are no null values in the dataset.
From the statistical description, we can see that some columns like Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, and BMI contain 0 as the minimum values, which is impossible. We have to convert the zeros to null values and fill or drop them.
The Pregnancy minimum value can be 0 because it indicates women who have never been pregnant.
